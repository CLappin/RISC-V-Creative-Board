# Programming files for RISC-V Creative Development Board Designs

### FlashPro Express
This folder includes FlashPro Express projects that can be used to program the development boards FPGA. 
A standalone installer for FlashPro Express is available [here](http://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/programming/flashpro#software). 
Please note that you only need to install this standalone version of FlashPro Express if you do not have Libero tools installed.
