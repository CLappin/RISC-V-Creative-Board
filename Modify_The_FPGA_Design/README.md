# RISC-V Creative Development Board RISC-V Designs
Sample Mi-V Libero project(s) for the RISC-V Creative board.

This folder contains a Libero project containing an FPGA design including a Mi-V soft processor. 

### Design Features
The FPGA designs include the following features:
* Uses MIV_RV32IMA_L1_AHB processor
* RISC-V debug block allowing on-target debug using openocd/GDB
* LSRAM for code/data
* User peripherals such as GPIO, Timers, UART
* Adafruit touch screen display
* Designs created with Libero capture 11.8.3.6

The memory map for each design is available within each Libero project.

### Libero Projects
* IGL2_MIV_RV32IMA_L1_AHB_TickTacToe:

   Contains design which enables Adafruit touch screen interface using CoreSPI. To use this design a daughter board is needed from Adafruit, more information on this can be found [here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1651).
   The design used along side of the TickTackToe example software found [here](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/RISC-V-Creative-Board/tree/master/Example_Software_Projects). This design uses legacy MIV_RV32IMA_L1_AHB soft processor.

* IGL2_MIV_RV32IMA_BaseDesign

   Uses MIV_RV32IMA_L1_AHB soft processor. Contains a simple RISCV design which allows users to use basic peripherals such as GPIO, UART and Timers.

### Target Hardware
The RISC-V Creative Development Board includes a IGLOO2 M2GL025 FPGA preprogrammed with a Mi-V processor design. Details of the features available for this development board are available [here](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/dev-kits/smartfusion2/future-creative-board) .

### Target Mi-V CPU
Details of the features of Mi-V CPUs are available [here](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/CPUs).


### Modifying the Libero projects
Some of the Libero projects use IP packages not directly available from the Microsemi IP Catalog. These IP packages were created to speed up design creation by wrapping simple logic into reusable user IP packages.
These user IP packages are available [here](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/CPUs/tree/master/Supporting-IPs).
